1.SUPER

-> Every time u called a constructor , first one is calling is the super() keyword.
-> Even the class is a parent class it will be calling super ,  because every class in java inherts the Object Class

2.Interface 

-> Every methods in Interface are public and abstract in default.
-> All the variable are by default are final and static
-> We can implements multiple interfaces
-> Interface to Interface use extends keyword

3.Annotations

-> It helps in avoiding bugs in the compile time itself 
-> eg: @override , @Depricated 

4.Functional interfaces

-> Have only one method
-> We can only use Lambda expression with Functional interface
-> Whenever in lamda is a single line and it is a return don't write the return

5.Throw

-> Whenever you wnat to handle the exception you can use the throw keyword


6.Finally

-> Whenever u have to do things irrespective of exception u can use Finally keyword.
-> instead of try-catch u can use the try-finally also.
-> whenever u want to close the connection or close the resources write that in finally 


7.Anonymous class

-> If the class is using only once its called anonymous class


8. HashMap and HashTable 

-> Both are the same actually but only differnce is HashMap is synchronized.


9. Comparator

-> Comparator is an interface which we uses when we need to use sort on our own logic.


10. Comparable

-> If you want things to be sorted using Collections.sort() that class should extends the Comparable.
-> Its a functional inertace with compareTo() method.

11. Stream

-> If you want to perfome some actions on your data without touching it you can use the stream().
